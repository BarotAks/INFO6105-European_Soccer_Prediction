# European Soccer Prediction

## Background
The UEFA Champions League, often known as the European Soccer League, is a continental football competition that attracts the best soccer teams from across Europe. The competition, which initially appeared in 1995 as the European Champion Clubâ€™s Cup, has emerged as the premier event in European football, drawing a huge international following.

## Motivation
As one of the most popular sports globally, the European Soccer League garners millions of fans who closely follow their favorite clubs and players. Predicting match outcomes in the European soccer dataset offers an opportunity to delve deeper into the game, its history, and the various factors that influence gameplay. Soccer match outcomes pose unique challenges due to fixed match durations, a single type of scoring (goals), and predetermined outcome possibilities (win, loss, or draw). Exploring different predictive techniques becomes enticing in order to predict match outcomes accurately.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use and compare prediction methods to forecast match outcomes and evaluate the models against bookmakers' accuracy. The primary tasks include data collection, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and building suitable training and testing pipelines for machine learning algorithms. Utilizing data from the European Soccer Database, this project aims to predict match outcomes, ranging from win, loss, to draw. The possibilities are limitless, encompassing player performance and match result forecasting.

## Methodologies
This section presents the process undertaken during the formation of the prediction models, elaborating on methods such as data collection, preparation, reduction, resampling, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis.

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Data Modeling
